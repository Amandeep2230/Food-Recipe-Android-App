#Food-Recipe-Android-App


This is an android app for food recipes. It has been developed using Android Studio. It basically lets the user choose among the recipes(Chinese cuisine in this app) and displays the recipe and the ingredients required along with the multimedia demonstrations.

I named this app "RecipeHub".

It is basically the first android application developed by me.

How to use?

Step1- Splash screen loads on the screen.

Step2- List of food items comes up and the user can select anyone among these.

Step3- The ingredients along with the instructions show up.

Step4- Screen displays a button which directs to the in-app video demonstration of the recipe.

Future Scope: Creating login system for users and the users can also uploadtheir own recipes and rate those uploaded by others. Discussion forums can also be added.
